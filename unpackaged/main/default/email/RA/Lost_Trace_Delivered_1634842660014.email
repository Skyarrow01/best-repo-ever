<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">We will initiate a trace with the carrier to determine if the driver knows exactly where the order was delivered. &nbsp;If the package is not located by the carrier within 72 hours, a lost package claim will be filed with the carrier for the items to be re-shipped.&nbsp; The replacement order must ship to a business address and requires a signature, or to a carrier location for pick-up.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Once filed, the time to process the claim and credit is typically 7 – 14 business days.&nbsp; Should you need your order before the carrier’s 72-hour location time expires, please place a new order.</span></span><br />
