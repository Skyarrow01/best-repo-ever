To ensure timely shipping of our customers' overnight orders, we ship via FedEx Priority Overnight.&nbsp; So that we meet your shipping expectations, this change was made on April 1, 2020.&nbsp; UPS pick-up times vary widely in our area, sometimes not being picked up until the next business day, which negatively impacted our customer experience.&nbsp; You may provide a FedEx collect account number to be noted on your account with AutomationDirect, or the shipping charges will be added to your invoice.
