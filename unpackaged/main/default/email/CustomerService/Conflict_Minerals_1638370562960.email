<br />
We will be using the industry standard EICC-GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template with our data gathering for Conflict Minerals. &nbsp; &nbsp;We will use version 6.01 and this will be the form we use throughout the 2022 calendar year. &nbsp;We will provide updates for new products that we offer, or if we get updated information from our suppliers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Due to the high volume of survey requests, the variety of different web portal requests, &nbsp;and the variety of the product information formats, AutomationDirect regrets that we cannot fill out individual Conflict Mineral Surveys or populate web portal surveys for our customers and we cannot individually upload our CMRT to other web portals. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
We will have filled out the industry standard EICC-GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template on a company wide basis for direct loading for your reporting purposes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For those companies that require conflict free supply, we will also provide the information on a product by product basis for those so that you can instruct your employees that purchase from us to purchase only products that meet your specific company requirements. &nbsp; This information is available at the same link above throughout the year, so that your employees can purchase only those products known to be conflict free, if that is your requirement. &nbsp;<br />
