Dear AutomationDirect Customer,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We have all experienced the impact of global supply chain issues in recent months to some extent, both in business and consumer transactions. &nbsp;In our industry, many suppliers are reporting extended supply disruptions such as material shortages, transit delays caused by unusually high port and rail congestion, work stoppages and resumption of work with partial staff, and reduction in plant production capacity. &nbsp;Although AutomationDirect continues to hold a significant amount of inventory overall with additional amounts continuously in transit, we are working diligently to maximize available inventory to you, our customers.<br />
<br />
Effective October 1st, if your company does not have Net 30 terms with AutomationDirect, we will enter the items from the purchase order into your Shopping Cart on our web store and email the Shopping Cart (with the subject “AutomationDirect Shopping Cart”) to you to complete the order through Checkout. &nbsp;You can confirm the shipping address, select the preferred ship method, and authorize the method of payment for the order to be processed for shipment. &nbsp;Pricing, stock availability, and lead times for any backorders will be provided during Checkout, with available stock allocated to your order when Checkout is complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best Regards,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
AutomationDirect Customer Experience&nbsp;<br />
