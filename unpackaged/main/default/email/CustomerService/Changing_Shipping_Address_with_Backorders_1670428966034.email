<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Due to shipping security compliance requirements, AutomationDirect cannot modify shipping addresses after an order has partially shipped. If you cannot receive the backorder at the original address, we will need to enter a new order. If a new order is entered, the current expected ship date is _____. If it at all possible, we advise shipping the backorder to the original address to retain your position for backorder allocation and forwarding it as needed. We understand this is frustrating to say the least, but we must remain in compliance with current shipping regulations.</body>
