<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">We completely understand your frustration with the expected ship dates being pushed out. &nbsp;It is extremely frustrating for us as well. &nbsp;We know you need reliable dates to serve your customers. &nbsp;When we send the email notification of the expected ship date changes, we are providing you with the most current information we have from our vendors to help our customers make buying decisions. &nbsp;AutomationDirect supply management is in continuous communication with our vendors to expedite what we can and get the best information possible on those parts the vendors are unable to expedite.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
